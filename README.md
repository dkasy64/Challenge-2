# Repo Automation
## Summary
The main purpose of this project is automate the process of turning an existing project into a gitHub repo. The user must input the file path of desired project, and then input what he want to name the Repo. Then click turn project into repo.
This project vastly decreases the time it takes to make a git repo and it takes away all of the steps of knowing the commandline commands.
## How to Run
You need an intergrated development environment(IDE). Something like eclipse or VScode will do. Then simply hit run. A graphical use interface(GUI) will pop up. You will input your desired file path and repo name into the associated text boxes. Then click turn project into repo. There are also buttons that will generate a README file and a gitignore file. Then click initial push. After that click on the output URL button which will generate the url of the gitHub repo that was just created.
